# star-coders-movie-picker

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/star-coders-movie-picker)

Project for high school students interested in learning about Angular. Build an app to help you decide what to watch on Netflix!

This project is a coding scavenger hunt. Complete the following challenges:

1) After you request a movie's information from the API, display the critic score, genre, and rating in the grey box at the top of each component. Currently ' -- ' is displayed there.        

2) Go to app.component.html and search for {{moviePlot}}. This is bound with the moviePlot property in app.component.ts. Get the movie's plot to display here after you search for a movie.

3) Add an option for 'Documentary' to the Genre component

If you finish early, try to see what else you can do to make the app easier or more fun to use!
